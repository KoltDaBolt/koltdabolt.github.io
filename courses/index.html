                    <h3>Computer Networking</h3>
                    <p>This course is designed to provide a full overview of computer networking, covering everything from the fundamentals of modern networking technologies and protocols to an overview of the cloud, as well
                        as practical applications and network troubleshooting. Topics studied includes the layers of the TCP/IP and OSI network models (Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presesntation, Application),
                        networking devices, IPv4 and IPv6 as well as subnetting, DNS and name resolution, DHCP, NAT, VPNs and Proxies and staying secure, the history of networking, wireless networking, the cloud, and basic
                        network troubleshooting technologies.

                    <h3>Web Dev II</h3>
                    <p>Development of web pages and full stack applications using your JavaScript/TypeScript framework of choice. My tech stack of choice was the MEAN stack: MongoDB, ExpressJS, Angular, NodeJS.
                        I also looked into other styling languages and frameworks such as SCSS, BootStrap, Bulma, etc. Other topics studied include web services and (REST) APIs, authentication vs. authorization,
                        security, and scalability.

                    <h3>Python to Interact with the OS</h3>
                    <p>This course, more focused on IT and automation senarios, covers using python to interact with the operating system, such as reading and writing files, file and directory management, dealing with CSV
                        files, regular expressions, data streams, subprocesses, log files, and also covers automatic testing and how to handle errors and exceptions.
